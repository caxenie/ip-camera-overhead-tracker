	Camera calibration helper tool that prints the coordinates of the selected points in camera space for 
			determining the camera-space to world-space mapping.

Select points in the stream rendering window and check the generated file. Using the measured world coordinates one can find the mapping value.

Compilation & run
==================

	# compile
	make

	# to clean the directory
	make clean 

	# run
	make run

General info
============
	# press q after selecting the points to finish the stream acquisition and dump coordintes to a file.

	# run command line 
	./calibration_helper <name_of_the_stream>

	e.g.: for the Axis IP Cam in the robot room

		# accessing the MJPEG (motion jpeg) stream
		./calibration_helper http://10.162.242.18/mjpg/video.mjpg
	
		# accessing the H264 RTSP stream (do not use, problems on Linux)
		./calibration_helper rtsp://10.162.242.18/axis-media/media.amp

	The results are stored in the calibration-points.txt.
